Instructions for running:
1. Order of the arguments presented does not matter.
2. The required arguments are min/max and text file. The program throws an error if insufficient arguments are passed or if the required arguments aren't passed.
3. The text file has to be present in the directory where the python file is.
4. The optional arguments behave exactly as the described in the question.

Example commands:
1. python lab1.py min inputfile.txt
2. python lab1.py min inputfile.txt -v
3. python lab1.py min inputfile.txt -v -ab
4. python lab1.py min inputfile.txt -v -ab range 10

Please feel free to reach out for any clarifications.
